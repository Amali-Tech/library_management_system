LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM API
## Overview
This Library management system API allows users to sign in and have access to a catalogue of books. The books is made available for rental or unavailable if already rented. 
The Librarian is the sole person that has Admin rights to the system. Their role will be to add librarians and generate an alphanumeric password for them. The password, together with their email will be used to sign into the system. On getting a password, a librarian is required to change the default password handed them by the authorising librarian. 
Ordinary users sign up into the system either with their email and password or through social authentication(googleâ€™s OAuth only). A user can request a book, and this is either approved or disapproved of by the librarian. Once a request is approved, that book becomes unavailable to other users until it is returned by the borrower. They also must return the book at the right time. 
When a book is due for return and it is not yet returned, set the user to be inactive for a month, starting from the day of expiry.
